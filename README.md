Git collaboration workshop

- `git clone <URL>`: downloads the repository from the web to our computer
  - Make sure you don't nest this command in another repository
  - Just like `git init` do this only once per repository

##Branches
- `git branch <branchname>`: create a new branch
- `git switch <branchname>`: move to a branch
  - `git checkout <branchname>`: old way of moving to branch

- `git switch -c <branchname>`: Create and move in one command
  - `git checkout -b <branchname>`

- `git stash`
  - `git stash apply`
